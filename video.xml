  <!--
  PERFORMANCE NOTE:
  ======================
  Videos are not that compatible with Raspberry Pi's. It is what it is.
  If you still want to choose video as the view layout, please turn OFF OMX Player.

  If OMX Player is turned on, zIndex values are ignored. In the case of this theme,
  the video will play on top of everything else (marquee, description, metadata).

  Please remember, when you turn off OMX Player and played a bunch of videos,
  Your Pi might overheat.

  This issue is only present in Raspberry Pi's (or maybe SBCs in general), as far as I know.
